## Redefining Financial Risk Management

**Value at Risk (VaR) analysis** is a globally accepted standard for quantifying financial risk, providing a clear estimate of the maximum potential downside for a portfolio with a given level of confidence.
Despite its effectiveness, the full potential of these analyses are often unrealized due to the high computational costs associated with advanced simulation techniques.
This challenge can lead to slower decision-making and missed market opportunities, ultimately affecting investment strategies.

**Margin Calculations** are a critical component of risk management, going beyond just about understanding potential losses by additionally ensuring sufficient capital reserves to meet margin requirements.
Accurately calculating margin is vital for maintaining liquidity, optimizing leverage, and avoiding costly margin calls.
By integrating high-performance GPU technology, Plutus enhances the speed and precision of margin calculations, empowering you to manage risk more dynamically and seize market opportunities with confidence.

**Why should AI companies be the only ones to benefit from hardware improvement?**
Vorticity's Plutus technology was created specifically for use on the latest high performance GPUs.
Using the same hardware that AI models run on, you'll be able to unlock huge benefits in performance and scalability.
