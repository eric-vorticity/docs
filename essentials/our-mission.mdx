**Value at Risk (VaR) analysis** is a globally accepted standard for quantifying financial risk, providing a clear estimate of the maximum potential downside for a portfolio with a given level of confidence.

**Why should AI companies be the only ones to benefit from hardware improvement?**
Plutus: VaR was created specifically for use on the latest high performance GPUs.
Using the same hardware that AI models run on, you'll able to unlock huge benefits in performance and scalability.
