## Margin Requirements

Once your portfolio is built, we’ll show you how to submit it to the Plutus:Margin engine and customize your margin calculation settings.

With Plutus:Margin, you can:
- Calculate **Initial Margin**: Determine the minimum amount of collateral required to initiate positions in your portfolio
- Calculate **Variation Margin**: Dynamically track the daily gains and losses on your open positions, enabling real-time adjustments to your margin requirements
- Calculate **Maintenance Margin**: Account for additional collateral requirements needed to maintain positions over time, especially during periods of heightened market volatility

Whether you need a basic risk estimate or a detailed simulation, our engine gives you flexibility and precision.

## VaR vs SPAN

Our margin calculation engine redefines precision and flexibility by utilizing a Value at Risk (VaR) methodology, delivering an advanced alternative to traditional SPAN-based systems.
By prioritizing VaR, Plutus:Margin offers a forward-thinking approach that empowers you to calculate margins with higher accuracy, adapt to evolving market dynamics, and optimize capital efficiency.

### Why VaR?

    **Granular Risk Assessment**:
        VaR measures the potential loss in portfolio value over a specific time frame and confidence level, providing a more accurate and nuanced understanding of risk compared to SPAN’s rigid, grid-based approach.
        It allows you to account for the correlations between assets, enhancing the precision of margin requirements.

    **Flexibility in Methodology**:
        Choose between Monte Carlo simulations for a more stochastic, scenario-driven analysis or Historical VaR, which leverages real market data for a realistic view of potential risks.
        Unlike SPAN, which relies on predefined risk scenarios, VaR provides a tailored calculation that adapts to your unique portfolio composition and market conditions.

    **Adaptability Across Asset Classes**:
        VaR can seamlessly handle portfolios with diverse asset classes, including stocks, options, futures, and bonds, without the constraints of SPAN’s scenario-based structure.

### Limitations of SPAN:

    **Inflexibility**: SPAN uses predefined market scenarios that may not align with your specific risk profile or the complexities of modern portfolios.

    **Siloed Calculations**: It often treats asset classes in isolation, missing the broader portfolio-level interactions and risk exposures.
    
    **Static Parameters**: SPAN’s fixed parameters lack the adaptability to changing market conditions, potentially underestimating risks during periods of high volatility.
