## Welcome!

In this documentation we will help you get started with Plutus:VaR.
Before we get started, we would like to mention that we also offer a Help Center which is more of an FAQ.
Here, you can find answers to individual questions and interact with our chatbot.
Additionally, you can submit tickets directly to our support team if you have any inquiries.

### Portfolio Building

We will cover everything, beginning with the supported asset types and their properties, where you will construct your first porfolio to be ready for submission.

### Value at Risk

Moving on, we will then go over how to submit a constructed portfolio to the engine with your personalized simulation settings.

### Risk Stress testing

Finally, we will go through some advanced features that go beyond your traditional risk computations, allowing you to stress test your portfolio through any number of completely customized scenarios.
