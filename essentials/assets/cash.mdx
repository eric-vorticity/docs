## Cash Positions - Coming Soon

Cash positions are an important part of many portfolios, and we are working hard to include support for them in the future.

Once the feature is available, cash positions will be able to be included in your portfolio submission with the following properties (subject to change):

### Expected Cash Position Properties

- **Currency**: The currency of the cash position (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP).
- **Amount**: The amount of cash held in the position, which could be positive (long) or negative (short).
- **Type**: Whether the cash position is `"long"` (holding cash) or `"short"` (borrowing cash).
