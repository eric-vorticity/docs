- **Is_Long**: Specifies whether the position is `"Long"` or `"Short"`.
- **Size**: The size of each futures contract.
- **Quantity**: The number of futures contracts held.

        "size": 50,
        "quantity": 100
    }
]
```
```json FPML/XML
<futures>
    <future>
        <ticker>ESH25</ticker>
        <is_long>true</is_long>
        <size>50</size>
        <quantity>100</quantity>
    </future>
</futures>

## Modeling Different Types of Futures Contracts

Futures contracts can be based on a wide range of underlying assets, including commodities, financial instruments, and currencies. Here are some common types of futures contracts you can model using the Plutus:VaR API:

### Commodity Futures
- **Example**: Oil futures (e.g. `"CLH25"` for crude oil or `"ZCH25"` for corn) give you the right to buy or sell a specific quantity of the commodity at a specified price on a future date.
  
### Interest Rate Futures
- **Example**: Treasury bond futures (e.g. `"ZBH25"` for 30-year US Treasury Bonds or `"EDH25"` for Eurodollars) are used to hedge or speculate on interest rate movements.

### Currency Futures
- **Example**: Currency futures (e.g. `"6EH25"` for Euros or `"6BH25"` for British Pounds) allow you to trade currency pairs, such as the Euro/USD or GBP/USD.

### Stock Index Futures
- **Example**: Stock index futures (e.g. `"NQH25"` for Nasdaq or `"YMH25"` for Dow Jones) allow investors to speculate on the movement of the overall stock market or hedge against potential market downturns.
