When using the Plutus:VaR API, you can include futures in your portfolio submission. Each futures position allows for the following customizable properties:

## Properties

- **Ticker**: The unique identifier for the futures contract (e.g., `"ES=F"` for the S&P 500 E-mini futures).
- **Type**: Specifies whether the position is `"Long"` or `"Short"`.
- **Maturity**: The contract expiration date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- **Quantity**: The number of futures contracts held.

## Modeling Different Types of Futures Contracts

Futures contracts can be based on a wide range of underlying assets, including commodities, financial instruments, and currencies. Here are some common types of futures contracts you can model using the Plutus:VaR API:

### Commodity Futures
- **Example**: Oil futures (e.g., `"CL=F"` for crude oil) give you the right to buy or sell a specific quantity of the commodity at a specified price on a future date.
- **Customization**: Adjust the `Ticker` field to represent commodities like oil (`"CL=F"`), gold (`"GC=F"`), or agricultural products like corn (`"ZC=F"`).
  
### Interest Rate Futures
- **Example**: Treasury bond futures (e.g., `"ZB=F"` for 30-year US Treasury Bonds) are used to hedge or speculate on interest rate movements.
- **Customization**: Modify the `Ticker` to reflect interest rate futures, such as `"ZB=F"` for treasury bonds or `"ED=F"` for Eurodollar futures.

### Currency Futures
- **Example**: Currency futures allow you to trade currency pairs, such as the Euro/USD or GBP/USD.
- **Customization**: Set the `Ticker` field to a currency pair like `"6E=F"` for Euro futures or `"6B=F"` for British Pound futures.

### Stock Index Futures
- **Example**: Stock index futures, like the `"ES=F"` for S&P 500 E-mini futures, allow investors to speculate on the movement of the overall stock market or hedge against potential market downturns.
- **Customization**: Use tickers like `"NQ=F"` for Nasdaq futures or `"YM=F"` for Dow Jones futures.
