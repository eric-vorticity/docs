When using the Plutus:VaR API, you can include futures in your portfolio submission. Each futures position allows for the following customizable properties:

## Properties

- **Ticker**: The unique identifier for the futures contract (e.g., `"ES=F"` for the S&P 500 E-mini futures).
- **Is_Long**: Specifies whether the position is `"Long"` or `"Short"`.
- **Size**: The size of each futures contract.
- **Quantity**: The number of futures contracts held.

## Modeling Different Types of Futures Contracts

Futures contracts can be based on a wide range of underlying assets, including commodities, financial instruments, and currencies. Here are some common types of futures contracts you can model using the Plutus:VaR API:

### Commodity Futures
- **Example**: Oil futures (e.g. `"CL=F"` for crude oil or `"ZC=F"` for corn) give you the right to buy or sell a specific quantity of the commodity at a specified price on a future date.
  
### Interest Rate Futures
- **Example**: Treasury bond futures (e.g. `"ZB=F"` for 30-year US Treasury Bonds or `"ED=F"` for Eurodollars) are used to hedge or speculate on interest rate movements.

### Currency Futures
- **Example**: Currency futures (e.g. `"6E=F"` for Euros or `"6B=F"` for British Pounds) allow you to trade currency pairs, such as the Euro/USD or GBP/USD.

### Stock Index Futures
- **Example**: Stock index futures (e.g. `"NQ=F"` for Nasdaq or `"YM=F"` for Dow Jones) allow investors to speculate on the movement of the overall stock market or hedge against potential market downturns.
