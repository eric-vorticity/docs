## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using API keys and picked up from the flag in the command.

```
-H 'x-api-key: your-api-key'
```
